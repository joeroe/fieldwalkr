# fieldwalkr

`fieldwalkr` is a tool for designing and evaluating sampling strategies in spatial survey (*fieldwalking* in archaeological jargon).
It contains functions for simulating the effect of different survey units, sampling methods and detection functions on the estimation of randomly generated or observed point processes.

## Installation

```{r}
devtools::install_github("joeroe/fieldwalkr")
```

The package is in an early stage of development.
I wouldn't recommend writing any serious code that depends on it yet, but you may find some functions useful.
