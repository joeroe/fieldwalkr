# fieldwalkr

`fieldwalkr` is a simulation framework for spatial surveys (fieldwalking in archaeologists' jargon), intended to be useful for exploring, designing, and evaluation sampling strategies.

## Installation

```{r}
devtools::install_github("joeroe/fieldwalkr")
```

The package is in an early stage of development. I wouldn't recommend writing any code that depends on it yet. 

Plus it's completely undocumented, so that would be hard anyway.

## Example

See `scripts/lunch_in_the_lab.R` for an example R script.
